AMPL codes for the Optimization discipline at UFPE


The Optimization discipline at UFPE required the modeling of a few problems related to optimization context.


The chosen modeling language was AMPL.

In AMPL, the modeling is divided into .dat and .mod.

The .dat file includes the declaration of the parameters, such as the sets and it's elements.

And the .mod file is the modeling itself of the problem, which includes the objective function and the restriction that the variables are subjected to.
